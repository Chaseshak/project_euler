# Project Euler
A repository for implementing my solutions to the popular mathematics and programming challenges found at [Project Euler](projectueler.net)


## Organization

Each solution will be in its own folder like such:

```
1-multiples-of-3-and-5/
|-solution.rb
|-lib/
  |-Some more files
```

Where `solution.rb` will contain the Ruby solution. Any other files for more complex solutions will be in that solutions `lib/` folder.
